--- gneural_network release 0.8.0

    02 Apr. 2016, J.M. Sellier, jeanmichel.sellier@gmail.com

    --- The previous (simplified) genetic algorithm has been
        drastically improved.
    --- A multi-scale Monte Carlo optimizer has been implemeted
        to train the neural network.
    --- New scripts have been implemented and are provided in
        the folder "tests", one which fits a quandratic curve,
        another which trains a network to compute the modulus
        of a two-dimensional vector and, finally, one which
        trains a network to invert the order of numbers in a
        given couple (a,b).
    --- Several bugs have been fixed.

--- gneural_network release 0.6.0

    --- The code has been divided into proper header and
        implementation files.
    --- The code and the scripting language have been
        generalized to handle a general number of neurons in
        both the input and output layers.
    --- A neural network can now be saved in a file specified by
        the user (to be loaded afterwards).
    --- Some part of the code have been further optimized
        to run faster.
    --- The user can now decide if the initial weights of a
        network have to be randomized before the training.
    --- Several important bugs have been fixed.

--- gneural_network release 0.5.0

    18 Mar. 2016, J.M. Sellier, jeanmichel.sellier@gmail.com

    --- The installation process has been standardized as
        it should be for a GNU package.
    --- A scripting language has been implemented which allows
        the user to define his/her own neural network without
        having to go through the source code.
        Plenty of options are now possible, for instance, the
        user can define the number of neurons, their connections,
        their discriminant, activation functions, etc.
        The user can choose among four different methods for
        training the neural network which can be saved for
        later use.
    --- Some part of the code have been optimized to run faster.
    --- A test folder has been created containing a commented
        example of script which defines a neural network for
        a simple curve fitting task.
